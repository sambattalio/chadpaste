I created this site out of boredom and wanting to play around with [AWS Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice).

It's fairly simple, but was fun to make and use.

I think the next step is **definitely** a frontend overhall haha.

Other than that, I would really like to change the POST to only require one call, and delegate the upload to s3 to the lambda.
